# Udacity Exercise Solution

This project contains a Python notebook that was used to solve an Udacity exercise. 

The project was about analyzing Airbnb housing data. I gathered the data, handled categorical and missing values, answered some business questions, and wrote a post to communicate the results to a non-technical audience.

The dataset I chose is available on Inside Airbnb. The dataset contained information about Airbnb listings, including their location, price, availability, and other features.The notebook downloades the data and uses it for your analysis. 

Once cleaned the data, I answered some business questions. For example, I investigated which neighborhoods had the highest average prices.

My post summarizes the findings.
